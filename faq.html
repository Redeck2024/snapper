  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <ol>

    <li>
      <h3>How do I enable snapshots for my /home file system?</h3>

      <p>You will have to create a snapper config for /home by calling:</p>

      <pre><code>snapper -c home create-config /home</code></pre>

      <p>You can also have a subvolume for every single home directory. Then
      create a snapper config for e.g. the user &quot;tux&quot; by
      calling:</p>

      <pre><code>snapper -c home_tux create-config /home/tux</code></pre>

      <p>In that case you can allow user &quot;tux&quot; to work with the
      config by calling:</p>

      <pre><code>snapper -c home_tux set-config SYNC_ACL=yes ALLOW_USERS=tux</code></pre>

    </li>

      <h3>Why does snapper never show changes in /var/log?</h3>

      <p>For some directories, openSUSE decided to disable snapshotting,
      e.g. &quot;/var/log&quot; since reverting logs makes searching for
      problems difficult. To exclude a path from snapshotting, openSUSE creates
      a subvolume for that path. You can see all subvolumes of &quot;/&quot;
      by calling &quot;btrfs subvolume list /&quot;.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>How can I exclude directories from snapshotting?</h3>

      <p>When you are using btrfs you can create
      <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/FAQ#What_is_a_subvolume.3F">btrfs
      subvolumes</a> for the directories you want to exclude from
      snapshotting. Unfortunately there is no dedicated command to
      <a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg33258.html">convert a
      directory to a subvolume</a>.</p>

      <p>For all filesystem types you can exclude directories from
      snapshotting by making the directories mount points.<p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Does snapper support ext4?</h3>

      <p>No, the support in snapper is discontinued and you need a
      special kernel and e2fsprogs. For more information see the next4
      project.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Does snapper support LVM?</h3>

      <p>Since version 0.0.12 snapper can handle LVM snapshots with
      thin-provisioning. See the
      blog <a href="http://snapper.io/2012/07/25/lvm-thin-snapshots.html">Snapper
      and LVM thin-provisioned Snapshots</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>My system has high I/O load after running YaST or zypper. What can I
      do?</h3>

      <p>When running YaST or zypper, snapper creates two snapshots and
      compares them. This comparison can cause high I/O load.</p>

      <p>Since snapper version 0.0.10, you can disable the background
      comparisons in the config file /etc/snapper/configs/root by setting:</p>

      <pre><code>BACKGROUND_COMPARISON=&quot;no&quot;</code></pre>

      <p>Now you might also want to disable cleanup of empty pre-post snapshot
      pairs since otherwise the daily cleanup can cause high I/O.</p>

      <pre><code>EMPTY_PRE_POST_CLEANUP=&quot;no&quot;</code></pre>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>I'm not using openSUSE. Can I still use snapper?</h3>

      <p>We provide snapper packages for various distributions in the openSUSE
      buildservice,
      see <a href='https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/filesystems:snapper'>project</a>
      and <a href='http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/filesystems:/snapper/'>download</a>. Of
      course you can also compile snapper from source,
      see <a href='/development.html'>development</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>I didn't install my system with YaST. How do I get started?</h3>

      <p>After you have installed snapper packages, you will have to create a
      config for your root filesystem by calling:</p>

      <pre><code>snapper create-config /</code></pre>

      <p>Then continue with the <a href='/tutorial.html'>tutorial</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>How do I add pre and post hooks (like YaST)?</h3>

      <p>You will have to insert two calls to snapper in your program or
      script. In the first call use the option --print-number, remember the
      value and pass it on to the second call. Have a look at /sbin/yast2 to
      see how this can be done in bash or at
      /usr/lib/zypp/plugins/commit/snapper.py for python.</p>

      <p>Since snapper version 0.0.9, you can also provide a command to
      snapper and snapper will create pre and post snapshots running the
      command in between, e.g.:</p>

      <pre><code>snapper create --command &quot;make install&quot; --description &quot;install mplayer&quot;</code></pre>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Does snapper really revert everything?</h3>

      <p>Snapper will revert all files (text and binary) including
      permissions, ownership and extended attributes and also remove and recreate
      files and directories. File timestamps are not reverted. Some files are
      excluded, e.g. /etc/mtab.</p>

      <p>It's recommended to always use the status command to see in
      advance what files snapper will process.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>How should I name my snapper configs?</h3>

      <p>Snapper does not require you to use special names for your configs.
      But here are some recommendations:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>The config for / should be called &quot;root&quot;.</li>
	<li>Configs for home directories should be named
	&quot;home_&lt;username&gt;&quot;.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>That way you can use <a href="/manpages/pam_snapper.html">pam_snapper</a> with
      the default configuration.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Are there GUIs for snapper?</h3>

      <p>Yes, there are independend projects providing GUIs for snapper:</p>

      <ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/yast/yast-snapper">yast2-snapper</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ricardomv/snapper-gui">snapper-gui</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>For help and questions about those projects please contact the
      corresponding author.</p>
